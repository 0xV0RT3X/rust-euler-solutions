# Rust Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Project Euler problems implemented in Rust programming language. Each solution is a standalone Rust program that provides the solution to a specific problem from the Project Euler website (https://projecteuler.net/).

## Project Euler

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. The problems require creative problem-solving skills and are an excellent way to practice and improve programming abilities.

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate directories, each representing a specific problem. Inside each problem directory, you can find the Rust source code file, along with any necessary input files or additional resources.

## Usage

To run a specific problem solution, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can follow the instructions provided in the [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to get it set up.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xV0RT3X/rust-euler-solutions
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory of the problem you want to execute:
   ```bash
   cd <problem-directory>
   ```
4. Use the following command to build and run the Rust program:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
   This command will compile and execute the Rust program associated with the selected problem.
   
## Disclaimer

Please note that Project Euler encourages solving the problems independently as part of the learning process. The solutions provided in this repository are intended for educational and reference purposes only.
